# Preserved OpenGD77 Downloads

For some time now, the official OpenGD77 website (`opengd77.com`) has been offline due to a prolonged DDoS attack. To help preserve access to important files that were previously hosted there, especially those under the `/downloads` section, I’ve mirrored the content in this repository.

## Access via GitHub Pages

The preserved files are also available via GitHub Pages for convenient browsing and download:
